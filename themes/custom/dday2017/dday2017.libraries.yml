# You can set CSS weights with 5 different levels of styling:
# - base key assigns a weight of CSS_BASE = -200
# - layout key assigns a weight of CSS_LAYOUT = -100
# - component key assigns a weight of CSS_COMPONENT = 0;
# - state key assigns a weight of CSS_STATE = 100
# - theme key assigns a weight of CSS_THEME = 200
# This is defined by the SMACSS standard.
# So here if you specify theme it means that the CSS file contains theme related styling
# which is pure look and feel.
# You cannot use other keys as these will cause strict warnings.
